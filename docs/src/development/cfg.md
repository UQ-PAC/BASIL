This page is outdated, it discusses an older version of the IR, and the deprecated CFG implementation for static analysis. 

# BASIL IR

Analysis is performed over the tool's own internal IR, [BASIL IR](#basil-ir). To do so, we need a way to take a program (assumed: binary), and transform it into this IR. To do this we use a tool to lift the Binary into an ADT (Abstract Data Type) - BAP lifts the ARM binary into its own IR, which it can then output as an [ADT](https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap/wiki/ADT). We parse this ADT into an internal representation of what BAP lifted, and then translate this into our IR. This is then what is used to perform analysis on, and later translate into Boogie. An overview of the translating processes is given here.

## Parsing Phase

[ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) is a tool which takes a grammar file (`BilAdt.g4`) and creates a parser in Java that exposes tokens of the grammar through classes. The parser is autogenerated at runtime [here](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/util/RunUtils.scala#L30C38-L30C38).

```Scala
val adtLexer = BilAdtLexer(CharStreams.fromFileName(fileName))
val tokens = CommonTokenStream(adtLexer)
val parser = BilAdtParser(tokens)
```

## Walking Phase
The `parser` object then stores the parsed ADT (Abstract Data Tree) of the program. We then walk the ADT in [`AdtStatementLoader`](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/translating/AdtStatementLoader.scala#L13), which happens [here](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/util/RunUtils.scala#L34).

```Scala
val program = AdtStatementLoader.visitProject(parser.project())
```
As the ADT is walked we transform tokenised ADT nodes into internal BAP IR structures, all defined [here](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/tree/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/bap). For example, a parsed direct call, stored by the parser as a `DirectCallContext`, will be [converted](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/translating/AdtStatementLoader.scala#L112) into a [`BAPDirectCall`](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/bap/BAPStatement.scala#L5).

These are all collated into a [`BAPProgram`](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/bap/BAPProgram.scala#L5), which is essentially a list of [functions](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/bap/BAPProgram.scala#L19) in the program, and known [memory sections](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/bap/BAPProgram.scala#L46), as represented by BAP.

## Translating Phase

We now have an internal representation of the program we want to analyse, stored as a mapping of how BAP lifted it. Instead of performing analysis on this, we translate this into our own [IR](#basil-ir). The BASIL IR was designed to be easily translated into Boogie, meaning any transformations of the program structure resulting from analyses should not hamper our ability to translate into Boogie.

With the ADT parsed, we then [match up](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/util/RunUtils.scala#L41) symbol names with procedures in the ADT via the output of `readelf`, stored in the associated `.relf`. This helps us identify external functions, internal functions, and global variables.

The `BAPProgram` is then [translated](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/util/RunUtils.scala#L68) into an IR [`Program`](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Program.scala#L7) via [`BAPToIR`](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/translating/BAPToIR.scala#L9).

We then [remove external functions](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/util/RunUtils.scala#L85) that we wish to ignore for analysis (such as `printf`), and [clean up](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/util/RunUtils.scala#L86) some BAP naming artefacts. At this point we have a BASIL IR of the program which we can then perform analyses over, and later translate to Boogie IVL.

## Derivation of the ADT grammar

The grammar of the parser is inspired by the existing parser found at [BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap-python](https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap-python), in particular, the nodes found in adt.py, br.py and bil.py. The grammar attempts to reflect the inheritance hierarchy - the alternatives of a token are its subclasses.

For example, `exp` and `term` are subclasses of `ADT`, and thus in the grammar we have `adt : exp | term | ...`.


## General Notes
- Negative numbers are encoded somewhat strangely. It takes the 2's complement representation of the number, and interprets the binary string as if it were an unsigned integer.
    - For example, the number -2 in 64 bits is 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111110, which is interpreted in the ADT as
    Int(18446744073709551614, 64).


# BASIL IR

The internal IR is designed such that it will translate easily to Boogie's IVL. The structure of the IR is given:

![](images/basil_ir.png)

## [Program](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Program.scala#L7)

Similar to BAP, this simply stores a list of known functions ([procedures](#procedure)) and [memory regions](#memory-section).

## [Procedure](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Program.scala#L32)

A procedure is a representation of a function call, e.g. `__libc_start_main`. It stores

- `name`    : the function's string representation (e.g. `"__libc_start_main"`).
- `address` : offset into the binary.
- `blocks`  : a list of blocks in the procedure. See [Block](#block) for an explanation of what constitutes a block.
- `calls`   : a list of function calls made by blocks in this procedure.

## [Memory Section](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Program.scala#L54)

Represents an abstract region of memory. It has an `address` and a number of bytes in `size`. It can also store a sequence of `bytes`, representing data in the memory region.

## [Block](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Program.scala#L40)

A basic block. Basic blocks in the context of this IR are consecutive sequences of instructions without a jump.

- `label`       : unique identifier for this block. This is the label that BAP gave it which has propagated through (its effectively a "BAP Address").
- `address`     : offset of the start of this block in the binary.
- `statements`  : sequence of [statements](#statement) in the block.
- `jumps`       : a sequence of one or more jumps from this block to other blocks or procedures. A jump will either be a (direct|indirect) call to a procedure or a [`GoTo`](#goto) statement to another block.

These sets are calculated and stored in the block also:

- `calls`       : names of functions (jumps) from this block which have been resolved (i.e. direct calls).
- `modifies`    : memory regions that are modified within this block.
- `locals`      : registers accessed during this block.

## [Statement](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Statement.scala#L5)

An expression (`rhs`) which is evaluated and stored into a register (`lhs`). For example, `R2 := 3bv32 + 20bv32` is a statement, with `lhs: R2` and `rhs: Expression(3bv32 + 20bv32)`.

- `modifies`    : memory regions that this statement modifies.
- `locals`      : registers that this statement accesses (writing or reading).

## [LocalAssign](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Statement.scala#L11)

Assigning a value to a local variable. Local in this context means local to the procedure scope. 

- `lhs`         : variable (local) which stores the evaluation of the `rhs` is stored in
- `rhs`         : expression to be evaluated and stored in `lhs`
- `modifies`    : empty for local.
- `locals`      : registers that this statement accesses (writing or reading).

## [MemoryAssign](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Statement.scala#L17)

Assigning a value to some memory region. A memory region can be on the stack, in the heap, or global.

- `lhs`         : memory region that the evaluation of the `rhs` is stored in
- `rhs`         : [`MemoryStore`](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Expr.scala#L303) expression to be evaluated and stored at memory region specified in `lhs`
- `modifies`    : [`Memory`](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Expr.scala#L335) regions that this statement modifies (`lhs` of statement).
- `locals`      : registers that this statement accesses (writing or reading).


## [Jump](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Statement.scala#L24)

A jump from this point in the program to another part in the program.

- `modifies`    : currently unused. NOTE: is this deprecated?
- `locals`      : dependencies for this jump. For example, a `goto` instruction will depend on some expression involving CPU flags. For procedure calls, these are parameters passed to the function call.
- `calls`       : currently unused. NOTE: is this deprecated?

## [GoTo](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Statement.scala#L31)

A jump directly to a specified address (Block in this instance), without any form of stack preparation or function prologue. Used in loops and conditionals.

- `target`      : the `Block` to jump to.
- `condition`   : if this is a conditional jump, the expression being evaluated to decide whether to jump
- `modifies`    : currently unused.
- `locals`      : any `Variable` used by the conditional expression, if this is a conditional jump.

## [DirectCall](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Statement.scala#L41)

Call to a procedure which is known.

- `target`      : the `Procedure` to jump to.
- `condition`   : if this is a conditional jump, the expression being evaluated to decide whether to jump.
- `returnTarget`: the `Block` to jump back to upon execution finish.
- `locals`      : any `Variable` used by the conditional expression, if this is a conditional jump.
- `calls`       : any `Procedure` that is called within the target of this call.

## [IndirectCall](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Statement.scala#L51)

Call to a procedure given by an expression which has not been resolved / evaluated yet.

- `target`      : the `Variable` storing the address to jump to.
- `condition`   : if this is a conditional jump, the expression being evaluated to decide whether to jump.
- `returnTarget`: the `Block` to jump back to upon execution finish.
- `locals`      : any `Variable` used by the conditional expression, if this is a conditional jump.

## [Expressions](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Expr.scala#L235)
All the above then depend [Expressions](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Expr.scala#L5), which contain representations for instructions to be evaluated / left symbolic, such as [literals](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Expr.scala#L26) and [binary operations](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Expr.scala#L222). [Boogie uses `BitVectors`](https://boogie-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/LangRef.html) for register values, and so operations in the BASIL IR are also represented as [`BitVector` operations](https://github.com/UQ-PAC/bil-to-boogie-translator/blob/171c67d3765a2fbd810440a3f5ee7617f63f9b0b/src/main/scala/ir/Expr.scala#L235).
