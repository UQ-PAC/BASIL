This verifies if the following loop invariant is added to the Boogie output:

```
main_1812__1__rlVqjjqoR6uHwOYvPCS15g:
  assume memory_load32_le(stack, bvadd64(R31, 24bv64)) == 0bv32;
  assume gamma_load32(Gamma_stack, bvadd64(R31, 24bv64));
```

This invariant simply saying that the local variable 'expected' from the source code is always 0 at the start of the loop and always has a low security level.
